# Rooster_Ranch (Test Build)

This is a minimal test build to verify:

- A **void world** named `rooster_farms` is created/loaded on startup.
- A **floating farm island** is generated near spawn (Skyblock style).

## Install
1. Build with `mvn package`
2. Drop `target/rooster-ranch-0.1.0.jar` into your server's `plugins/` folder.
3. Start the server.

## Notes
- This is an MVP scaffolding build; farming-sim systems and RC economy will be layered on next.
